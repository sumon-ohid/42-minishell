DONE -signals should be handeled in un-interactive mode.(cat; SIGNAL)

DONE - CTRL + C from heredoc LEAKS

DONE -cntrl-c in << prints extra line

DONE -signal exit code is 130 (for newline too & for heredoc)

DONE - $? should be 130 when we quit from heredoc (this is tricky as heredoc can be in a child)

DONE -"_=" doesnt work (it about =)\

DONE - echo + etc doesnt work

-env is one line less than it should be (_=/usr/bin/env)

-SHLVL doesnt increase

- env -i : we should still have PWD, SHLVL & _=/usr/bin/env

DONE -exit receives argument (also pay attention to more than 1 argument- when both are int or non-numeric, bigger tahn long int and smaller than min int)

DONE -echo "'$USER'" and echo "$USER'" has expansion problem

DONE (for nothing only) -ambiguous redirection is not implemented (when you redirect to an expansion which expand to 0 or more than 1 thing)

-empty promt ("") sould return command not found

DONE -export A="hello       world" seperates hello and world as differet tokens (check it with echo $A)(also be carefull to not mess the case below by fixing this:
export A="123 | cat"; echo $A;)

DONE -exit minishell with the same exit code as $? (test echo "something" | ./minishell and the echo $?)

DONE -inside here_doc expansion doesnt work if you have quotation.

NO -mkdir a; cd a; mkdir b; cd b; rm -rf ../../a; cd .. exit your minishell (it should say no such file or dir)

-unset TERM; clear shouldnt work; (DIRTY clear technique!!!)

-cat | ls doesnt work properly (its because you dont wait() correctly)
