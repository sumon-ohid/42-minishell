- e$A-hello A="cho" echo should work
- . - etc should break a varname (parser issue)
DONE - $nonexist | cat has leaks
DONE - "" | cat also has a leak
??? cat | ls + CtrlC we need extra newline
- print segfault message for sigsegv
DONE - echo should ignore all -n flags after the first (unitl broken by . or something)
DONE - exit should not have value beyond long max & should work with negatives
??? - whatever we unset (PWD etc) should not go back into export, only env
??? - PWD should also update like OLDPWD
DONE - we should not exit if CD fails, + PWD should not be updated in that case
DONE - unset path -> absolute path should still work
DONE - always check local executables
- access thinks executable with no permissions still exists
- in path i should not split until : but EOF also
- chmod 000 infile, cat < infile is not found (should be perm denied)
DONE - export should accept only letters, numbers (ex first char) and _
DONE - "export" doesnt work, but with flags it does????
DONE - unset "USER" doesnt work, should work
DONE - env -i + commands had conditional jump issue
REMOVED - unset OLDPWD + cd - we should have an error msg (or remove cd -)
DONE - always exit the shell with $? (ctrl + C into newline then exit and we get 0)
REMOVED - "$$" expands but only in quotes??
DONE - echo || echo should be syntax error
- cat << "$USER" -> mhuszar should not be a delim!
- but cat << $USER -> $USER should be delim
DONE - cd : too many arguments should be handled
- export VAR="hehe haha" should break into 2 tokens
DONE - export PIPE="|" then echo $PIPE - WHY DOES IT WORK??
DONE cat | cat | cat etc then Ctrl+\ prints a shit ton of QUIT msg

Benjamin eval
DONE - lot of children then heredoc delimited with anything - LEAKS << yy | << zz | << xx
DONE - export | export doesnt work???
- : at the end or beginning or path or :: anywhere - path is unset & set at the same time?
DONE - export "'" doesnt work anymore???
DONE - absolute path needs to be fixed
- extra newline when heredoc is delimited with ctrl+D

Ismayil found:
- 0000000000000000000000000007 should still work for exit
