- e$A-hello A="cho" echo should work
- . - etc should break a varname (parser issue)
- $nonexist | cat has leaks
- "" | cat also has a leak
- cat | ls + CtrlC we need extra newline
- print segfault message for sigsegv
DONE - echo should ignore all -n flags after the first (unitl broken by . or something)
- exit should not have value beyond long max & should work with negatives
- whatever we unset (PWD etc) should not go back into export, only env
- PWD should also update like OLDPWD
- we should not exit if CD fails, + PWD should not be updated in that case
- unset path -> absolute path should still work
- always check local executables first
- access thinks executable with no permissions still exists
- in path i should not split until : but EOF also
- export should accept only letters, numbers (ex first char) and _
- "export" doesnt work, but with flags it does????
- unset "USER" doesnt work, should work
DONE - env -i + commands had conditional jump issue
- unset OLDÃœWD + cd - we should have an error msg (or remove cd -)
- always exit the shell with $? (ctrl + C into newline then exit and we get 0)
- "$$" expands but only in quotes??
- echo || echo should be syntax error
- chmod 000 inflie, cat < infile is not found (should be perm denied)
- cat << "$USER" -> mhuszar should not be a delim!
- cd : too many arguments should be handled
- export VAR="hehe haha" should break into 2 tokens
DONE - export PIPE="|" then echo $PIPE - WHY DOES IT WORK??
- cat | cat | cat etc then Ctrl+\ prints a shit ton of QUIT msg
